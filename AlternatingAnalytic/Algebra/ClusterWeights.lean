# Four-position cluster weights

The operator weights `s = (1, 0, -1, 0)` and vector weights `w = (1, -1, 1, -1)` on a
four-point cluster, from Appendix B before Lemma B.11. Each has total zero, and the
products `s_i w_j` sum to zero over each of the patterns `i < j`, `i = j`, `i > j`.
The identities hold over every commutative ring.
